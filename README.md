The queue bot takes 6 users into a queue and then shuffles them up into two teams of three players. 
The bot then creates two Discord voice channels, one for the Orange team and one for the Blue team.

This bot has the prefix "!" and has the following commands:

```
q = upon a user typing this command, they are added to the queue if the queue has less than six people.
leave = upon a user typing this command, they leave the queue if they're in the queue.
status = upon a user typing this command, the current users in the queue pop up.
```
